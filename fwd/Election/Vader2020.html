  <p class="focus">The Dark Side's mission is to bring peace order and the imperial way back to the galaxy. The republic has been losing for a long time now, with the radical Jedi terrorists spouting their propaganda, the corrupt senate officials swamping our government, and the oligarchic, wealthy, bantha poo-doos' who run the trade federation, it’s a wonder the galaxy is still here. Our mission is to make the galaxy civilized again, we will bring order and law to mankind throughout the galaxy!</p>

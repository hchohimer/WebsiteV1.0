      <h4>Demo 3</h4>
      <p>For this demo, I modeled a fighter jet. This was a fun excercise, and the free-form modeling tool will be very useful.</p>

      <h4>Why Design Matters</h4>
      <p>This was an interesting talk. Alain de Botton has a lot of interesting points when it comes to design. I was very interested in the section when Alain speaks about how design is not only about what people like, but about what people are afraid of. I find this interesting because his second example of the wealthy Belgian family shows that designing for someone’s fear, can also be the best way to design a beautiful object. I think the overlap of psychology and design is an interesting one, and I enjoyed the way that Alain explored that overlap. In a similar vein, when Alain speaks about how classical architecture he makes the point that the goal of classical architecture is to make people more like the ancient Greeks and Romans. I had never thought about it this way before, and it has changed the way that I think about how design is not just about the feelings evoked, but is about the suggestions that design gives off. Another idea that Alain speaks about is how design is a reflection of our perfect selves, that well designed objects are attractive to people because they evoke a feeling of perfection which people desire to attain. In his words, we want to be the best designed objects in our lives.</p>

      <h4>Assignment 2</h4>
      <p>For my assignment 2 I am thinking of modeling some sort of skull. I think a viking skull would be a fun monopoly piece, while also being a fun project to model.</p>

      <h4>Assignment 1</h4>
      <p>For this assignment, I made a Desktop Cup Holder. It works by increasing the width of the base of a can and adding weight so that accidental bumps will not result in a spilled beverage. The cup holder is only 3" high which is a benefit in this case as it allows for cups designed for car cup holders to also work with this version. The cup holder also has a groove on the bottom matching the standard US aluminum can size for optimal stability. The stylish walls of the holder also allow for an easier grip.</p>

      <h4>Demo 2 - The Tea Pot</h4>
      <p>Our second demo expanded on the first by showing the level of work that goes into increasingly complex designs. This one was also really neat even though it was difficult, the rail sweep tool was really impressive.</p>

      <h4>Reading Response 09/28/2017</h4>
      <p>These were interesting readings for this week. The article about the 10 rules of good design was interesting because it can easily see that design philosophy reflected in almost everything I use. They are good rules to follow, and I agree with them, but I am not sure whether the idea is to hold all rules equally, or to hold to the rules to varying degrees. Because I can see holding to all the rules to create a kind of boring result. For example, I really like the Art Nuevo period, which is not modernist at all. I also like the art deco period. I think that while they weren’t timeless, they are memorable, arguably more so than timeless things. The chair in the example of timelessness is from the 60’s, but I didn’t no that, It could have been from any time in the last 80 years. But I’m not sure if that makes it good or if that makes it forgettable. On the same note, I would love to be a UX designer, and in UX design, the secret is to be forgettable, but I am not sure that should apply to everything.  I like modernism, but pure modernism bores me, it’s like black Helvetica on a white background. It’s just plain, not new, seen before. But I do think that these philosophy ideas can still apply to the current modernist trends of less is more, some sometimes more is needed.

      <h4>Assignment 2 Final</h4>
      <p>For Assignment 2, I bounced around with a lot of ideas. The fact that we could do anything, made me want to model everything. After being unable to make up my mind for a week, I thought back to the general idea of Monopoly. At its core, it is a game about capitalism, and a game about making as much money as possible. As I contemplated that fact I realized that monopoly was missing a piece which truly symbolized the core concept of the game. So, I decided on making a stack of money, being shuffled so as to add some interesting curves and make the piece more fun to use and hold. Check it out below!</p>

      <h4>Why Design Matters</h4>
      <p>This was an interesting talk. Alain de Botton has a lot of interesting points when it comes to design. I was very interested in the section when Alain speaks about how design is not only about what people like, but about what people are afraid of. I find this interesting because his second example of the wealthy Belgian family shows that designing for someone’s fear, can also be the best way to design a beautiful object. I think the overlap of psychology and design is an interesting one, and I enjoyed the way that Alain explored that overlap. In a similar vein, when Alain speaks about how classical architecture he makes the point that the goal of classical architecture is to make people more like the ancient Greeks and Romans. I had never thought about it this way before, and it has changed the way that I think about how design is not just about the feelings evoked, but is about the suggestions that design gives off. Another idea that Alain speaks about is how design is a reflection of our perfect selves, that well designed objects are attractive to people because they evoke a feeling of perfection which people desire to attain. In his words, we want to be the best designed objects in our lives.</p>

      <h4>Assignment 2</h4>
      <p>For my assignment 2 I am thinking of modeling some sort of skull. I think a viking skull would be a fun monopoly piece, while also being a fun project to model.</p>

      <h4>Assignment 1</h4>
      <p>For this assignment, I made a Desktop Cup Holder. It works by increasing the width of the base of a can and adding weight so that accidental bumps will not result in a spilled beverage. The cup holder is only 3" high which is a benefit in this case as it allows for cups designed for car cup holders to also work with this version. The cup holder also has a groove on the bottom matching the standard US aluminum can size for optimal stability. The stylish walls of the holder also allow for an easier grip.</p>

      <h4>Demo 2 - The Tea Pot</h4>
